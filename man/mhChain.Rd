\item{prior_distributions}{List, containing prior distributions for the parameters being estimated.}

\item{prev}{Numeric, the prevalence of the risk allele in the population.}

\item{median_max}{Logical, indicates if the maximum median age should be used for the Weibull distribution.}

\item{var}{Numeric, the variance for the proposal distribution in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.}

\item{age_imputation}{Logical, indicates if age imputation should be performed.}

\value{
A list containing samples, log likelihoods, log-acceptance ratio, and rejection rate for each iteration.

\description{
Performs a single chain execution in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for Bayesian inference,
specifically tailored for cancer risk estimation. This function can handle both sex-specific and
non-sex-specific scenarios.
