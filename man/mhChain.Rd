\arguments{
\item{seed}{Integer, the seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility.}

\item{n_iter}{Integer, the number of iterations to perform in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.}

\item{burn_in}{Integer, the number of initial iterations to discard (burn-in period).}

\item{chain_id}{Integer, the identifier for the chain being executed.}

\item{ncores}{Integer, the number of cores to use for parallel computation.}

\item{data}{Data frame, containing family and genetic information used in the analysis.}

\item{twins}{Information on monozygous twins or triplets in the pedigrees.}

\item{max_age}{Integer, the maximum age considered in the analysis.}

\item{baseline_data}{Numeric matrix or vector, containing baseline risk estimates for different ages and sexes.}

\item{prior_distributions}{List, containing prior distributions for the parameters being estimated.}

\item{prev}{Numeric, the prevalence of the risk allele in the population.}

\item{median_max}{Logical, indicates if the maximum median age should be used for the Weibull distribution.}

\item{BaselineNC}{Logical, indicates if non-carrier penetrance should be based on SEER data.}

\item{var}{Numeric, the variance for the proposal distribution in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.}

\item{age_imputation}{Logical, indicates if age imputation should be performed.}

\item{imp_interval}{Integer, the interval at which age imputation should be performed when age_imputation = TRUE.}

\item{remove_proband}{Logical, indicates if the proband should be removed from the analysis.}

\item{sex_specific}{Logical, indicates if the analysis should differentiate by sex.}
}
\value{
A list containing samples, log likelihoods, log-acceptance ratio, and rejection rate for each iteration.

\description{
Performs a single chain execution in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for Bayesian inference,
specifically tailored for cancer risk estimation. This function can handle both sex-specific and
non-sex-specific scenarios.
