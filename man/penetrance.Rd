\arguments{
\item{pedigree}{A data frame containing the pedigree data in the required format. It should include the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{PedigreeID}: A numeric value representing the unique identifier for each family. There should be no duplicated entries.
\item \code{ID}: A numeric value representing the unique identifier for each individual. There should be no duplicated entries.
\item \code{Sex}: A numeric value where \code{0} indicates female and \code{1} indicates male. Missing entries are not currently supported.
\item \code{MotherID}: A numeric value representing the unique identifier for an individual's mother.
\item \code{FatherID}: A numeric value representing the unique identifier for an individual's father.
\item \code{isProband}: A numeric value where \code{1} indicates the individual is a proband and \code{0} otherwise.
\item \code{CurAge}: A numeric value indicating the age of censoring (current age if the person is alive or age at death if the person is deceased). Allowed ages range from \code{1} to \code{94}.
\item \code{isAff}: A numeric value indicating the affection status of cancer, with \code{1} for diagnosed individuals and \code{0} otherwise. Missing entries are not supported.
\item \code{Age}: A numeric value indicating the age of cancer diagnosis, encoded as \code{NA} if the individual was not diagnosed. Allowed ages range from \code{1} to \code{94}.
\item \code{geno}: A column for germline testing or tumor marker testing results. Positive results should be coded as \code{1}, negative results as \code{0}, and unknown results as \code{NA} or left empty.
}}

\item{twins}{A list specifying identical twins or triplets in the family. For example, to indicate that "ora024" and "ora027" are identical twins, and "aey063" and "aey064" are identical twins, use the following format: \code{twins <- list(c("ora024", "ora027"), c("aey063", "aey064"))}.}
